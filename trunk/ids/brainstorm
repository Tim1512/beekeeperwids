the container unit for kb analytics will be the 'App'. The app will take manage the data receiver server, interacting with the drones, setting up the database, and launching/managing analytic processes, and running the rule engine.

the app will be extensible by employing plugins. There will be two types of plugins: 1) analytic plugins and 2) event plugins. 

analytic plugins will read data received from the drones, run analytic functions, and upon meeting a condition, execute an event. 

event plugins will provide 'action' functionality for analytic plugins. common events will include, writing to a log file, generating an 'Event', running a script, etc.


the 'detection' of threats can occur in two ways. the first is via the analytic plugins themselves. a single plugin can search for packets machting specific conditions, and upon finding such a packet, any number of events will be generated. the action of the event can be anything implemented by an event plugin. 

for advanced detection mechanisms that requires multiple analytic plugins working together, 'rules' can be used. rules will be similiar to snort rules. a simple case will be waiting for a number of different 'events' generated by different analytic plugins and then generating yet another event. 

via the rule engine, simple analytic plugins can be combined to create arbitrarily complex detection analytics
