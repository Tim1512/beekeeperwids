This is a IEEE 802.15.4 Wireless Intrusion Detection System.
This is currently a beta release, developed to show the feasibility
of intrusion detection techniques to 802.15.4. We aim to continue to
add detection modules to this, and we ask for the contributions of
other researchers in contributing additions both to the detection
modules, and to the core architecture as desired.


Organization
------------

This software uses the KillerBee framework and the 802.15.4 (dot15d4)
layer of Scapy (available in the scapy-com repository).
